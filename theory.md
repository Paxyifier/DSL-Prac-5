# Queue
A queue is a linear data structure in which elements are added at one end and removed from the other end. It follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

1. Queue Implementation Using Array:

In this method, an array is used to store the elements in the queue. The front of the queue is represented by the first element of the array, and the rear of the queue is represented by the last element.

To enqueue an element, it is added at the rear of the queue. The time complexity of this operation is O(1).

To dequeue an element, the element at the front of the queue is removed. The time complexity of this operation is O(1).

2. Queue Implementation Using Linked List:

In this method, a linked list is used to store the elements in the queue. The front of the queue is represented by the head of the linked list, and the rear of the queue is represented by the tail of the linked list.

To enqueue an element, it is added at the rear of the queue. The time complexity of this operation is O(1).

To dequeue an element, the element at the front of the queue is removed. The time complexity of this operation is O(1).

3. Circular Queue Implementation Using Linked List:

In this method, a circular linked list is used to store the elements in the queue. The front of the queue is represented by the head of the linked list, and the rear of the queue is represented by the tail of the linked list.

To enqueue an element, it is added at the rear of the queue. The time complexity of this operation is O(1).

To dequeue an element, the element at the front of the queue is removed. The time complexity of this operation is O(1).

4. Double Ended Queue Implementation Using Linked List:

In this method, a double ended linked list is used to store the elements in the queue. The front of the queue is represented by the head of the linked list, and the rear of the queue is represented by the tail of the linked list.

To enqueue an element, it can be added either at the front or at the rear of the queue. The time complexity of this operation is O(1).

To dequeue an element, the element at the front or at the rear of the queue can be removed. The time complexity of this operation is O(1).

5. Priority Queue Implementation Using Linked List:

In this method, a priority linked list is used to store the elements in the queue. The elements are stored in the queue based on their priority, with the highest priority element at the front of the queue.

To enqueue an element, it is added to the queue based on its priority. The time complexity of this operation is O(n), as the element needs to be inserted at the correct position based on its priority.

To dequeue an element, the element at the front of the queue is removed. The time complexity of this operation is O(1).
